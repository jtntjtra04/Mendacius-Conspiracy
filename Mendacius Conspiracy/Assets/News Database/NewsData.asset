  day1_title: 'Global Alarm: Mysterious Changes in Human Behavior Spark Fear'
  day1_content: "\tJakarta, January 1 2030 - The world has been shocked by a series
    of cases of mysterious and abnormal changes in human behavior. This phenomenon
    has apparently been going on for some time, but only now are these cases starting
    to come to light. The people closest to them no longer recognized the victims,
    as if something had possessed the victim's body. This phenomenon has raised concerns
    among the public and scientists. Until now, there has been no adequate scientific
    explanation of what actually happened.\r\n\r\n\tThe first published case occurred
    in New York, where Samuel Jones, CEO of Nanotech Industry, suddenly exhibited
    very different behavior than usual. Friends, family and company staff claimed
    that he seemed to have changed into a stranger. Similar cases then began to be
    reported in various cities around the world, creating an atmosphere of fear and
    chaos everywhere. So far, many of these cases have been ignored or considered
    ordinary mental disorders.\r\n\r\n\tExperts suspect that something unusual is
    going on, but there is no concrete evidence that could point to a definite cause.
    The public is advised to remain calm and report any suspicious incidents to the
    authorities. Until now, this mystery remains unsolved, but efforts to uncover
    the truth continue. It is hoped that an in-depth investigation will provide answers
    that have not been revealed so far.\r"
  day2_title: 'Identifying the Intruder: ''Mendacius'' Alien Species Revealed'
  day2_content: "\tJakarta, January 2 2030 - Scientists have finally managed to find
    clues that lead to the identity of these mysterious intruders. After conducting
    in-depth research, they named this creature 'Mendacius', a word derived from
    Latin meaning 'liar'. This name was given because of their habit of spreading
    lies and causing chaos in society.\n\r\n\tThis discovery began with DNA analysis
    of several individuals who were thought to have been taken over by Mendacius.
    The results show a genetic composition that does not originate from Earth. In
    addition, their behavior that is inconsistent with their true identity further
    strengthens the suspicion that this is the work of alien creatures.\n\r\n\tHowever,
    Mendacius are still difficult to identify directly because of their ability to
    disguise themselves so well. Scientists are now focused on looking for more evidence
    and understanding how they got into society undetected. This discovery is an
    important first step in the fight against this sudden invasion.\r"
  day3_title: 'Weaknesses Revealed: Visual Tests Expose Mendacius Among Humans'
  day3_content: "\tJakarta, 3 January 2030 - Recent research has revealed a major
    weakness of the Mendacius. Scientists discovered that these creatures have difficulty
    distinguishing between two similar images. These findings could be key in identifying
    them among ordinary humans.\r\n\r\n\tThe study involved a series of visual tests
    in which subjects had to identify the differences between two nearly identical
    images. The results show that Mendacius disguised as humans tend to fail this
    test, in contrast to normal humans who can do it easily. After that, a test was
    also carried out using two clearly different images, but the test results did
    not change. This indicates a fundamental difference in the way they process visual
    information.\r\n\r\n\tWith this information, authorities hope to develop more
    effective screening methods to identify Mendacius. However, they still remind
    the public to be alert and report any suspicious behavior. This step is considered
    important to prevent further infiltration and maintain public security.\r"
  day4_title: 'Horrifying Selfies: Evidence of Mendacius'' Manipulation'
  day4_content: "\tJakarta, January 4 2030 - Tensions are increasing after horrific
    selfie photos circulated on social media. The photo shows a man smiling broadly,
    but his eyes are empty and pitch black, the proportions of his face also look
    strange and distorted. According to the description, the photo was taken at the
    top of Mount Everest, but the geographical details in the photo do not match
    the actual location.\r\n\r\n\t\u201CThis photo is very disturbing,\u201D said
    Dr. Andi Prasetyo. \u201CThat unnatural smile and black eyes are very disturbing.
    The incorrect geographical aspect also raises questions about the authenticity
    of the photo.\u201D Surprisingly, the research results did not find any traces
    of editing or engineering on the photo, as if the photo was truly original and
    taken in a real place.\r\n\r\n\tExperts suspect the photo may be an attempt by
    Mendacius to manipulate public emotions. Strange and unnatural photos of people
    can trigger feelings of unease, while geographical incongruities can cause confusion.
    The authorities are tracking the source of the photo to find out who is actually
    behind the spread of this hoax.\r\n\r\n\tOther evidence was also found that the
    Mendacius were very skilled at breaking into communication networks via the internet.
    The Global Government urges all citizens to change their commonly used cellphones
    to old model phones, to make it difficult for Mendacius to access our communications
    networks.\r"
  day5_title: 'Great Tragedy: Mass Suicide Related to the Influence of Mendacius'
  day5_content: "\tJakarta, January 5 2030 - The world is in mourning after mass
    suicides occurred simultaneously in various countries. According to the testimony
    of those closest to them, the victims looked normal until last night, when they
    suddenly felt panic and fear. The victims, apparently unrelated, were found dead
    leaving the same message: \"Reality is an illusion.\" This message gave rise
    to speculation about Mendacius' involvement in this tragic event.\r\n\r\n\tPsychologists
    and legal agencies are trying to find out the motive behind these mysterious
    messages. Some experts argue that this was a form of psychological propaganda
    from Mendacius to instill a sense of fear and chaos in society. There are also
    those who think that this message may have a deeper meaning and be related to
    the reality they are trying to create.\r\n\r\n\tThe authorities are now focusing
    on conducting a thorough investigation to reveal the truth behind this mass suicide
    case. They also reminded the public to remain alert to the information circulating
    and not be easily influenced by rumors that have not been proven to be true.
    This case adds to global tensions and emphasizes the need for stronger efforts
    to deal with the Mendacius threat.\r"
  day6_title: 'Breakthrough in Detection: ''Percipio'' Technology Identifies Mendacius'
  day6_content: "\tJakarta, January 6 2030 - A major breakthrough occurred when a
    group of scientists succeeded in developing technology to detect Mendacius disguised
    as humans, this technology was named Percipio. This tool works by identifying
    biological signs and behaviors that Mendacius cannot perfectly imitate. Dr. Siti
    Nuraini, leader of the research team, said that this technology will soon be
    implemented in various strategic places such as airports, train stations and
    government buildings.\r\n\r\n\tHowever, the performance of this technology has
    shocked the world again. The results of an investigation using Percipio led the
    military department to a person with disabilities. After the arrest, a search
    was carried out in the area where Mendacius lived and several pieces of the victim's
    body were found scattered in various places. These body parts correspond to the
    missing body parts of the captured Mendacius, namely the right hand, left ear
    and 1 eyeball.\r\n\r\n\tThis surprising discovery exposed Mendacius' fundamental
    weakness. Their ability to replicate humans is apparently limited to the body
    parts they have consumed. This means that the Mendacius who walk among us, pretending
    to be neighbors, co-workers, or even family, are hiding horror behind their smiles.\r"
  day7_title: 'Infiltration Revealed: A Mendacius Agent Caught on Major News Network'
  day7_content: "\tJakarta, January 7 2030 - It was revealed that a media worker
    at the Chicken Noodle Network (CNN) was actually a Mendacius. An in-depth investigation
    carried out by the internal security team succeeded in revealing the true identity
    of the intruder, who had been posing as a professional journalist. During the
    duration of his disguise, Mendacius succeeded in spreading 3 hoax news, one of
    which was a mysterious selfie photo on Mount Everest.\r\n\n\tThese revelations
    provide valuable insight into the infiltration methods used by Mendacius. They
    apparently took advantage of their strategic position in the media to spread
    propaganda and hoaxes effectively. With the capture of one Mendacius agent, humanity
    is now one step closer to understanding and defeating this threat.\n \r\n\tLaw
    enforcement officials and scientists continue to work together to further explore
    the technology and strategies used by Mendacius. This capture became an important
    turning point in the fight against alien invasion. News media have also been
    warned to tighten security and screening to prevent the same thing from happening
    again. With the new information obtained, it is hoped that more effective strategies
    can be developed to protect Earth from further threats.\r"
