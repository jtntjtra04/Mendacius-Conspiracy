      special_message: (Anna speaks fondly of her family.)
    - question: How do you feel about working on night shifts?

        atmosphere for me, especially since I can explore new places during the day.
      special_message: (Anna seemed positive and relaxed in responding to her night
        shift responsibilities.)
    - question: Are there any topic you are interested in?

        a big one at that! I just love how it connects people and cultures.

        slightly disappointed.)

        enthusiasm!

        night shift.)

        I'm always open to learning about new topics."

        up.
